# Patch and Release
Draft for a release process. Things to include, thoughts and structure

---

### **1. Key Questions to Ask Yourselves**

These questions will help shape your initial process:

- **What types of changes qualify as patches?**
  - Bug fixes only? Minor enhancements?
- **How frequently do we want to release patches?**
  - On-demand, weekly, bi-weekly?
- **Who approves a patch before release?**
  - QA lead, product owner, dev lead?
- **What environments do we use (e.g., dev, test, staging, prod)?**
- **What testing is required before a patch can be released?**
  - Unit, integration, regression, smoke?
- **How do we track and document patches?**
  - Ticketing system, changelog, versioning?
- **What is the rollback plan if a patch fails?**
- **Who is responsible for deploying the patch?**
  - DevOps, developers, QA?

### **2. What to Include in the Draft**

#### ✅ **Include in the Basic Process Now**
- Patch definition and scope
- Trigger for patch creation (e.g., bug report)
- Approval and testing steps
- Basic release checklist
- Communication plan (who gets notified and how)
- Ownership and responsibilities

#### ⏳ **Wait to Implement Later**
- Automation (CI/CD pipelines, automated testing)
- Detailed rollback procedures
- Metrics and KPIs (e.g., patch success rate)
- Integration with monitoring/alerting tools
- Full documentation templates

### **3. Draft: High-Level Patch and Release Process**


#### **Patch and Release Process**

**Purpose:**  
To ensure that software patches are tested, approved, and released in a controlled and predictable manner.

**Scope:**  
Applies to all production patches including bug fixes and minor enhancements.

---

**Step 1: Patch Identification**  
- Triggered by a bug report or urgent issue.
- Logged in the issue tracking system.

**Step 2: Patch Development**  
- Developer creates a fix in a dedicated branch.
- Quality steps, for example: Code is peer-reviewed.

**Step 3: Testing**  
- **Role** tests the patch in a test/staging environment.
- Minimum tests: For example regression, smoke, and verification of the fix.
 
**Step 4: Approval**  
- **Role** signs test approval
- **Role** gives final approval.

**Step 5: Release**  
- Patch is deployed to production during a designated release window.
- Deployment is logged and communicated to stakeholders.

**Step 6: Post-Release Monitoring**  
- Monitor for issues post-release.
- Rollback if critical issues are found.
