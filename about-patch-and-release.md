The term **"patch and release"** is often associated with small, targeted fixes—like bug patches or security updates—but **it doesn't have to be limited to that**. In modern software development, especially with Agile and DevOps practices, the boundaries between patching and feature releases are more fluid.

### ✅ When "Patch and Release" Is Appropriate
- **Bug fixes**
- **Security updates**
- **Performance improvements**
- **Minor UI tweaks**
- **Hotfixes for production issues**

These are typically **small, low-risk changes** that can be released quickly and independently of major development cycles.

### 🚫 When "Patch and Release" Is *Not* Ideal for New Features
Using a patch process to release **new features** can be problematic if:

- The patch branch bypasses normal QA or feature validation.
- The release cadence is meant to be stable and predictable.
- The feature introduces breaking changes or requires migrations.
- It violates your team's versioning strategy (e.g., SemVer).

---

### ✅ When It *Can* Be Okay to Use It for Features
In **modern CI/CD pipelines**, especially with **feature flags** and **trunk-based development**, it's common to:

- Merge small features into the main branch continuously.
- Release them behind flags or toggles.
- Include them in minor or even patch releases if they’re backward-compatible.

### 🔁 Better Terminology for Broader Use
If you're releasing both fixes and features regularly, you might want to use terms like:

- **Incremental release process**
- **Continuous delivery pipeline**
- **Rolling release model**
