### Draft: **High-Level Patch and Release Process**


#### **Patch and Release Process**

**Purpose:**  
To ensure that software patches are tested, approved, and released in a controlled and predictable manner.

**Scope:**  
Applies to all production patches including bug fixes and minor enhancements.

**Patch Criteria:**
Define explicitly what qualifies as a patch vs. a feature release. For example:
 - Patch: Bug fix, security update..
 - Minor enhancements: erformance tweak, small UI change..
 - Minor Release: Backward-compatible enhancements..
 - Major Release: Breaking changes or new features..

---

### 1. **Identify and Prioritize Issues**
- **Source**: Bug reports, user feedback, automated monitoring.
- **Triage**: Classify issues by severity (e.g., critical, major, minor).
- **Prioritize**: Decide which issues need immediate attention.

### 2. **Create a Patch Branch**
- Branch off from the latest stable release (e.g., `release/v1.2.3`).
- Name it clearly (e.g., `hotfix/critical-login-bug`).

### 3. **Develop the Patch**
- Apply minimal, targeted changes to fix the issue.
- Ensure no unrelated features or refactors are included.
- Quality steps, for example: Code is peer-reviewed, follows coding standards, and includes comments.

### 4. **Test the Patch**
- **Unit Tests**: Ensure the fix works in isolation.
- **Regression Tests**: Confirm the fix doesnâ€™t break existing functionality.
- **QA/UAT**: Optional user acceptance testing for critical patches.

### 5. **Code Review and Approval**
- Submit a pull request (PR) for review.
- At least one peer review is recommended.
- Use automated checks (CI/CD pipelines).

### 6. **Release**  
- Merge the patch into the release branch.
- Tag the release (e.g., `v1.2.4`).
- Patch is deployed to production during a designated release window.

### 7. **Communicate the Release**
- Update changelogs and documentation.
- Notify stakeholders (e.g., via email, Slack, release notes).

### 8. **Post-Release Monitoring**  
- Monitor for issues post-release.
- Rollback if critical issues are found.
- Conduct a retrospective if the patch was critical.
- Identify improvements for future patches.
